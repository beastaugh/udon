Udon
====

Functional programming has a number of common, idiomatic operations: maps,
folds, currying and so on. There are a number of excellent JavaScript libraries
which provide access to these fundamentals in a more-or-less functional style.
[Ojay]'s core extensions, Oliver Steele's [Functional] and Jeremy Ashkenas'
[Underscore] are all good examples.

[Udon] is cast in a similar mould to the above. It aims to provide basic
support for functional programming in JavaScript, initially by porting some
elements of Haskell's `Data.List` library.

Installing Udon
---------------

Udon is available from [npm], so if you want to use Udon with [Node] you can
just run the following command to globally install the library.

    npm install -g udon

Then it's just a matter of requiring it in your Node project. The module
exported by the library is just the top-level Udon object.

    var Udon = require('udon');
    
    Udon.sum([1, 2, 3, 4]); // -> 10

Otherwise, you can grab pre-built versions from the [Udon website][Udon] or
build it yourself as described below.

[npm]:  http://npmjs.org/
[Node]: http://nodejs.org/


Building the library
--------------------

If you've checked out the Git repository and want to build a minified version
of the library from source, you will need [Ruby], [Rubygems] and the [Jake]
gem, which you can get by running (with `sudo` if you like)

    gem install jake

from the command line. Then just `cd` into your Udon directory and run

    jake

which will build the library in the `/pkg` directory.

[Rubygems]: http://rubygems.org

Running the test suite
----------------------

The Udon test suite is written with the [JS.Test] testing framework. The test
suite runs on several JavaScript platforms, including [Node] and all modern web
browsers.

To run the test suite from the command line, run the following command
(replacing `node` with [Rhino], [V8] etc. where relevant).

    node test/console.js

To run the test suite in a browser, open the `test/browser.html` file in a web
browser.

[Node]:    http://nodejs.org
[Rhino]:   http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/
[V8]:      http://code.google.com/p/v8/


Building the Udon website
-------------------------

The website is built with [Hakyll], a static site generator written in
[Haskell]. To build it you will need [GHC] and [cabal-install]; the simplest
way to get hold of these is to install the [Haskell Platform]. You'll also need
to install the `hakyll` package from [Hackage]:

    cabal install hakyll

Then, to build the site, just run this from your Udon directory:

    ghc --make -Wall site/site
